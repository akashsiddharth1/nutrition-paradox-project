1. Global Obesity Is Rising Steadily
Line plots clearly show an upward trend in obesity rates across nearly all regions.

High-income countries like those in Europe and the Americas have the highest obesity levels, especially among adults.

Even in lower-income regions, a gradual rise in obesity rates is visible, hinting at a global shift in dietary patterns and lifestyle.


2. Malnutrition Remains Persistent in Specific Regions
Africa and South-East Asia consistently show high malnutrition levels, especially among children.

Box plots reveal greater variability in malnutrition rates compared to obesity, indicating disparities within regions.



3. The “Double Burden” of Malnutrition & Obesity
Some countries (e.g., India, Egypt, South Africa) appear in both the top malnutrition and top obesity lists.

The scatter plot comparing obesity and malnutrition shows no clear inverse relationship, reinforcing the idea that both can coexist in the same population — especially across age groups and income classes.


4. Gender-Based Differences Are Apparent
Obesity rates are often higher among females, particularly in the Americas and Eastern Mediterranean.

For malnutrition, in contrast, males are slightly more affected in several regions, especially among children.


5. Widening Confidence Intervals in Low-Income Countries
CI_Width is often broader in countries with weaker health infrastructure, suggesting less reliable or more varied data.

This can obscure trends and create challenges for policymaking.


6. Emerging Economies Showing Fast Transitions
Countries like Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey show rising obesity alongside falling malnutrition, suggesting a nutritional transition.

These shifts align with urbanization, processed food adoption, and reduced physical activity.


This dual burden of nutrition is not just a health problem — it's a socioeconomic, cultural, and policy challenge. Addressing both undernutrition and overnutrition simultaneously will require targeted interventions, cross-sector collaboration, and context-aware strategies.
