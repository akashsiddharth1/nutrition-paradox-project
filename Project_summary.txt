üåç Global Nutrition Analysis: Tackling Obesity and Malnutrition with WHO Data
This project investigates the global nutritional paradox: the co-existence of undernutrition and overnutrition (obesity) across different countries, age groups, and genders using publicly available WHO (World Health Organization) data.

üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview
We extract, clean, analyze, and visualize global obesity and malnutrition trends between 2012 and 2022, then insert the cleaned data into a MySQL database for long-term storage and querying.

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Workflow
1. üì• Data Collection from WHO API
We use 4 WHO public API endpoints:

Indicator	API URL (WHO)
Obesity (Adults)	https://ghoapi.azureedge.net/api/NCD_BMI_30C
Obesity (Children)	https://ghoapi.azureedge.net/api/NCD_BMI_PLUS2C
Malnutrition (Adults)	https://ghoapi.azureedge.net/api/NCD_BMI_18C
Malnutrition (Children)	https://ghoapi.azureedge.net/api/NCD_BMI_MINUS2C

2. üßπ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Loaded data from APIs using requests and converted JSON into DataFrames.

Filtered records from 2012 to 2022.

Selected relevant columns:

ParentLocation, Dim1, TimeDim, Low, High, NumericValue, SpatialDim

Renamed columns for clarity:

TimeDim ‚Üí Year, Dim1 ‚Üí Gender, NumericValue ‚Üí Mean_Estimate, etc.

Standardized Gender labels to 'Male', 'Female', and 'Both'.

Merged datasets:

df_obesity: Combined adult and child obesity datasets.

df_malnutrition: Combined adult and child malnutrition datasets.

Created age_group column manually to distinguish between Adult and Child/Adolescent.

Converted 3-letter country codes to full country names using the pycountry package.

Handled regional placeholders like 'AFR', 'GLOBAL', etc. using a special dictionary.

Calculated Confidence Interval Width:

CI_Width = UpperBound - LowerBound

Created new classification columns:

obesity_level: Low, Moderate, High (based on BMI value)

malnutrition_level: Low, Moderate, High (based on underweight %)

3. üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we explored:

Distribution of obesity and malnutrition across years, genders, and regions

Line plots to observe trends over time

Boxplots to analyze variability by gender and age group

Bar plots to compare top/bottom affected regions

Heatmaps and scatter plots for pattern detection

4. üíΩ Data Insertion into MySQL
Used mysql.connector to connect to a local MySQL server.

Created two SQL tables: obesity and malnutrition

Inserted cleaned records from Pandas DataFrames into MySQL using .iterrows() loop.

Key Insights 
Regions Requiring Urgent Intervention
Africa (especially Sub-Saharan), South-East Asia, and Yemen face critical malnutrition rates.

The Americas and Gulf countries show dangerously high obesity rates, especially among adults.

Trends Over Time
Obesity is consistently rising globally.

Malnutrition shows a nonlinear trend: improvements in some countries, worsening in conflict-affected regions.

 Vulnerable Demographics
Children and Adolescents face a double burden in developing economies.

Females often exhibit higher obesity prevalence, especially in urban settings.

Rural male populations remain more affected by undernutrition in some African countries.

Data Reliability
Regions with high CI_Width values reflect inconsistent monitoring, and need better data infrastructure.

Encourage use of standardized methods for BMI and nutrition surveys.

Public Health Strategies Informed by Findings
Double-duty policies: Tackle obesity and malnutrition simultaneously through integrated food systems and education.

Targeted campaigns: Address gender-specific obesity and regional undernutrition with culturally tailored interventions.

Invest in data quality: Especially in regions with high CI_Width ‚Äî better data = better policy.

School-based programs: Essential for reaching the child/adolescent demographic ‚Äî nutrition education + physical activity.

Conclusion
This project highlights how open data, thoughtful preparation, and analytics can be combined to uncover hidden patterns and support evidence-based decision making in public health. Tackling the nutrition paradox requires both local context and global awareness ‚Äî and this data-driven approach provides the tools to do exactly that.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Requests, Pycountry)

MySQL for relational data storage

WHO API for real-time health data
